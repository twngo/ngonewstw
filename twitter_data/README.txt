direct-message.js
-----------------
Contains the text and associated metadata for Direct Messages (DMs) and Group Direct Messages (GDMs) sent or received by the account.
* conversationId: DMs are grouped by conversations. The conversation IDs are created by joining two user IDs of the two participants in the conversation. For example, if one participant’s user ID is 1234 and the other participant’s user ID is 7890, the conversation ID will be 1234-7890. The conversation IDs are ordered from the lowest to highest value of the first user ID. Within a conversation, the DMs are ordered in reverse chronological order, meaning that the latest DM will be at the top of the list. DMs contain information (e.g., user ID and text of message) for both the sender and receiver.
* messages: List of each message sent or received by the account. Variables that may be included in any particular Direct Message are defined in our API documentation: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/guides/message-create-object

NOTE: This data may be split into multiple parts/files depending on the volume of messages. Due to user deletions, the file may not contain comprehensive logs of join events, participants lists, name change events, and message create events.

Group Direct Messages (GDMs) contain information (e.g., user ID and text of message) for both the sender and the other participants of the group. Group Direct Messages are grouped by conversations. The conversations will be ordered in chronological order, based on when the conversation was created. This means that the conversation that is created first is listed at the top of the file. Within a conversation, the logged events are ordered in reverse chronological order, meaning that the latest event will be at the top of the list.

Additional logged events in the GDM file include:
- Join Conversation event: occurs when a user adds other participants to the conversation.
- Conversation name change events (change the name of the conversation).
- Message create event: this is the actual DM and is shown when a DM message is created by a user.
- Leave event: when a user leaves the group DM conversation.
